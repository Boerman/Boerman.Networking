# Boerman.TcpLib

The Boerman.TcpLib library provides both a TCP client and TCP server implementation. These implementations work seamlessly with each other. On the other hand, there is in no way a requirement to use these implementations with each other. For generic use you can send whatever string you want through the implementations.

Mayor features:

- .NET Standard 2 target platform
- Performant implementation
- Efficient use of threads over multiple sockets
- Flexibility to implement further functionality
- Proved its stability in real world IoT implementations

## Installing the library (NuGet)
The library is available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Boerman.TcpLib/)

    Install-Package Boerman.TcpLib

## Using the library
Both client and server implementations look pretty much alike.

### Basic TCP client
To get started with a basic TCP client:

***Hey hold on for a second imma gonna make this library a bit easier to use before finishing these docs. I'll be back with you shortly***

## Real world usage
- The client is being used in the [Boerman.Aeronautics.AprsClient](https://github.com/Boerman/Boerman.Aeronautics.AprsClient) library.
